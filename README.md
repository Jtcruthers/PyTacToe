The board is split into 9 tiles. The top-left is tile 0 and the bottom-right is tile 8. There are two ways to specify which tile you want to mark:

1) You can use the abbrivation for the tile in XY format, where X is the row and Y is the column's first inital. 
For the bottom-right tile (8), simply type "br". For the top-middle (1), type "tm".

2) You can also use the tile number. For the top-left (tl), type "0".
